      <h1>About this game</h1>
      <p className="text-balance">
        The game has a lot of timewalls, and even begins with one - so be
        prepared for that. At first, the game may feel slow and uninteresting,
        but once you reach 1M points, the experience becomes much more engaging.
        Additionally, all upgrades without level limits can be purchased
        multiple levels at once, but you only pay for the last level. For
        example, if the cost for levels 1, 2, and 3 is 10, 20, and 30 points
        respectively, you only pay 30 points for upgrading to level 3 directly.
        With this knowledge, you can drastically speed up your progress.
      </p>
      <p className="info-important mb-[3em]">
        Frequently exporting your save is highly recommended because the game is
        still in beta, and potential bugs may reset your progress.
